This software has been programmed to locate IPs where we are going to look them up according databases.
The library that has been used is python-geoip which provides access to GeoIP databases, here is the link if you want to look it up https://pythonhosted.org/python-geoip/

To use Ambush is very simple you just have to open in terminal the program and type the IP. If you're struggling trying tp get the IP I can recomend you NSLOOKUP from your terminal or website http://www.kloth.net/services/nslookup.php
